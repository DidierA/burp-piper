<p>Piper makes integrating external tools into Burp easier.</p>
<p> In true Unix
fashion, small things that do one thing and do it well can be connected
together like building blocks to aid quick experimentation. By lowering
the level of coupling, any programming language can be used as long as
it can accept inputs on the standard input or as command line
parameters.</p>
<p>Extending message editors for new formats or integrating a
better comparator/diff tool is as simple as filling a short form with
the command line and some details with sensible defaults.</p>
<p>Useful configs
can be shared using the the textual YAML format, the defaults already
contain some simple examples.</p>
